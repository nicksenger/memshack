# Memshack

WIP: this is not currently functional because I got distracted with learning neural network stuff for some other work

## Goals

**Memshack** will allow for deployment and management of a [Mcrouter](https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter) ([Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached)) cluster using [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) custom resource definitions.
